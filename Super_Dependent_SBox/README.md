# Analysis of Super-Dependent S-Boxes

## Brute Force Implementation 💻

### Algorithm Breakdown
1. **Generation Phase**:
   ```python
   AllF = list(range(1 << n))  # Generate all possible values [0, 2^n-1]
   ```
   - Why this works: Covers all possible n-bit outputs
   - Complexity: Generates 2ⁿ values

2. **Permutation Testing**:
   ```python
   for permuted in permutations(AllF):
       # Test each permutation as potential S-box
   ```
   - Ensures one-to-one mapping requirement
   - Handles 2ⁿ! possible arrangements

3. **Dependency Checking**:
   ```python
   function_extraction = [(num >> function_position) & 1 for num in permuted]
   ```
   - Extracts each coordinate function
   - Uses bitwise operations for efficiency

4. **Validation**:
   ```python
   if function_extraction[index] ^ function_extraction[index ^ (1 << check_function)]:
       # Checks for bit changes
   ```
   - XOR operation to detect changes
   - Tests all possible input combinations

### Performance Analysis 📊
- **Time Complexity**: O(n × n × 2ⁿ! × 2ⁿ)
- **Practical Limits**: 
  * Works well for n ≤ 3
  * Becomes infeasible for larger n
  
## Known Results & Applications 🎯

### Proven Results
1. **n = 2**:
   - S(2) = 0
   - No super-dependent S-boxes exist

2. **n = 3**:
   - S(3) = 2,576
   - Exhaustively verified

3. **n > 3**:
   - Monte Carlo simulation recommended
   - Theoretical bounds available

### Important Properties
1. **Addition Property**:
   - Super-dependent S-box + binary vector = super-dependent S-box
   - Useful for generating families of solutions

2. **Balanced Function Requirement**:
   - All coordinate functions must be balanced
   - Takes zeros and ones equally often

### Key Points to Emphasize
1. **Problem Complexity**:
   - Exponential growth with n
   - Need for different approaches based on n

2. **Solution Methods**:
   - Brute force for small n
   - Mathematical framework for larger n

### Discussion Points
1. **Trade-offs**:
   - Exhaustive search vs. theoretical bounds
   - Accuracy vs. computational feasibility
   - Implementation challenges
